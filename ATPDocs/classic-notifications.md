# Classic portal: Set Microsoft Defender for Identity notifications

> [!NOTE]
> The experience described in this page can also be accessed at <https://security.microsoft.com> as part of Microsoft 365 Defender. The supporting documents for the new experience can be found [here](/microsoft-365/security/defender-identity/notifications). For more information about Microsoft Defender for Identity and when other features will be available in Microsoft 365 Defender, see [Microsoft Defender for Identity in Microsoft 365 Defender](/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-365-security-center-mdi).

Microsoft Defender for Identity can notify you when it detects a suspicious activity and issues a security alert or a health alert via email.

To receive notifications to a specific email address, set the following parameters:

1. In the Defender for Identity portal, select the settings option on the toolbar and select **Configuration**.

1. Click **Notifications**.
1. Under **Mail notifications**, add email addresses for the notifications you want to receive - they can be sent for new alerts (suspicious activities) and new health issues.

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > - Emails are only sent for notifications with defined email addresses.
    > - Email alerts for suspicious activities are only sent when the suspicious activity is created.

1. Click **Save**.
