# Microsoft Defender for Identity monitored activities

Microsoft Defender for Identity monitors information generated from your organization's Active Directory, network activities and event activities to detect suspicious activity. The monitored activity information enables Defender for Identity to help you determine the validity of each potential threat and correctly triage and respond.

In the case of a valid threat, or **true positive**, Defender for Identity enables you to discover the scope of the breach for each incident, investigate which entities are involved, and determine how to remediate them.

The information monitored by Defender for Identity is presented in the form of activities. Defender for Identity currently supports monitoring of the following activity types:

> [!NOTE]
>
> - This article is relevant for all Defender for Identity sensor types.
> - Defender for Identity monitored activities appear on both the user and machine profile page.
> - Defender for Identity monitored activities are also available in Microsoft 365 Defender's [Advanced Hunting](https://security.microsoft.com/advanced-hunting) page.
