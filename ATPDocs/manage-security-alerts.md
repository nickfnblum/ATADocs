# Investigate Defender for Identity security alerts in Microsoft 365 Defender

This article explains the basics of how to work with Microsoft Defender for Identity security alerts in [Microsoft 365 Defender](/microsoft-365/security/defender/overview-security-center).

Defender for Identity alerts are natively integrated into Microsoft 365 Defender with a dedicated Identity alert page format.

The Identity alert page gives Microsoft Defender for Identity customers better cross-domain signal enrichment and new automated identity response capabilities. It ensures that you stay secure and helps improve the efficiency of your security operations.

One of the benefits of investigating alerts through [Microsoft 365 Defender](/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-365-defender) is that Microsoft Defender for Identity alerts are further correlated with information obtained from each of the other products in the suite. These enhanced alerts are consistent with the other Microsoft 365 Defender alert formats originating from [Microsoft Defender for Office 365](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security) and [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint). The new page effectively eliminates the need to navigate to another product portal to investigate alerts associated with identity.

Alerts originating from Defender for Identity can now trigger the [Microsoft 365 Defender automated investigation and response (AIR)](/microsoft-365/security/defender/m365d-autoir) capabilities, including automatically remediating alerts and the mitigation of tools and processes that can contribute to the suspicious activity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As part of the convergence with Microsoft 365 Defender, some options and details have changed from their location in the Defender for Identity portal. Please read the details below to discover where to find both the familiar and new features.

## Review security alerts

Alerts can be accessed from multiple locations, including the **Alerts** page, the **Incidents** page, the pages of individual **Devices**, and from the **Advanced hunting** page. In this example, we'll review the **Alerts page**.

In [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://security.microsoft.com), go to **Incidents & alerts** and then to **Alerts**.

### Security alert categories

Defender for Identity security alerts are divided into the following categories or phases, like the phases seen in a typical cyber-attack kill chain.

- [Reconnaissance alerts](reconnaissance-alerts.md)
- [Compromised credential alerts](compromised-credentials-alerts.md)

## Manage alerts

If you select the **Alert name** for one of the alerts, you'll go to the page with details about the alert. In the left pane, you'll see a summary of **What happened**:

:::image type="content" source="media/what-happened.png" alt-text="The What happened pane" lightbox="media/what-happened.png":::

Above the **What happened** box are buttons for the **Accounts**, **Destination Host** and **Source Host** of the alert. For other alerts, you might see buttons for details about additional hosts, accounts, IP addresses, domains, and security groups. Select any of them to get more details about the entities involved.

On the right pane, you'll see the **Alert details**. Here you can see more details and perform several tasks:

- **Classify this alert** - Here you can designate this alert as a **True alert** or **False alert**

    :::image type="content" source="media/classify-alert.png" alt-text="The page on which you can classify an alert" lightbox="media/classify-alert.png":::

- **Alert state** - In **Set Classification**, you can classify the alert as **True** or **False**. In **Assigned to**, you can assign the alert to yourself or unassign it.

- **Alert details** - Under **Alert details**, you can find more information about the specific alert, follow a link to documentation about the type of alert, see which incident the alert is associated with, review any automated investigations linked to this alert type, and see the impacted devices and users.

   :::image type="content" source="media/alert-details.png" alt-text="The Alert details page" lightbox="media/alert-details.png":::

- **Comments & history** - Here you can add your comments to the alert, and see the history of all actions associated with the alert.

    :::image type="content" source="media/comments-history.png" alt-text="The Comments & history page" lightbox="media/comments-history.png":::

    :::image type="content" source="media/manage-alert.png" alt-text="The Manage alert option" lightbox="media/manage-alert.png":::

    You can also export the alert to an Excel file. To do this, select **Export.**

    > [!NOTE]
    > In the Excel file, you now have two links available: **View in Microsoft Defender for Identity** and **View in Microsoft 365 Defender**. Each link will bring you to the relevant portal, and provide information about the alert there.

## Tuning alerts (Public Preview)

Tune your alerts to adjust and optimize them, reducing false positives. Alert tuning allows your SOC teams to focus on high-priority alerts and improve threat detection coverage across your system. In Microsoft 365 Defender, create rule conditions based on evidence types, and then apply your rule on any rule type that matches your conditions.
