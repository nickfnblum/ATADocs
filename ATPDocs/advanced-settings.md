# Advanced settings

This article explains how to work with Microsoft Defender for Identity advanced settings in Microsoft 365 Defender.

## Removing the learning period for alerts

Microsoft Defender for Identity sensors detect suspicious activities on your network and alert you of any potential threats. The alerts generated by Defender for Identity are based on various factors such as profiling, deterministic detection, machine learning, and behavioral algorithms that it has learned about your network. The full learning process for Defender for Identity can take up to 30 days per domain controller.

However, there may be instances where you would like to receive alerts even before the full learning process has been completed. For example, when you install a new sensor on a domain controller or when you're evaluating the product, you may want to get alerts immediately. In such cases, you can turn off the learning period for the affected alerts by enabling the **Remove learning period** feature.

When enabled, every alert that is based on learning or profiling will be triggered instantly. Although this feature can be useful, enabling it might result in a high volume of alerts, including some that might be legitimate activity. So it's highly recommended to only enable this feature for a short period of time.

When the **Remove learning period** feature is enabled, Defender for Identity will continue to learn about your network environment.

For more information on which alerts have learning periods, see the alerts listed in [Microsoft Defender for Identity Security Alerts](alerts-overview.md).

>[!NOTE]
> Turning this feature on for tenants who have already completed their learning period won't delete the learned profiles, but will simply ignore them.

### How to remove the learning period
