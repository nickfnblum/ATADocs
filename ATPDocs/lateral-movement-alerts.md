# Lateral movement alerts

Typically, cyberattacks are launched against any accessible entity, such as a low-privileged user, and then quickly move laterally until the attacker gains access to valuable assets. Valuable assets can be sensitive accounts, domain administrators, or highly sensitive data. Microsoft Defender for Identity identifies these advanced threats at the source throughout the entire attack kill chain and classifies them into the following phases:

1. [Reconnaissance and discovery alerts](reconnaissance-discovery-alerts.md)
1. [Persistence and privilege escalation alerts](persistence-privilege-escalation-alerts.md)
1. [Credential access alerts](credential-access-alerts.md)
1. **Lateral movement**
1. [Other alerts](other-alerts.md)

To learn more about how to understand the structure, and common components of all Defender for Identity security alerts, see [Understanding security alerts](understanding-security-alerts.md). For information about **True positive (TP)**, **Benign true positive (B-TP)**, and **False positive (FP)**, see [security alert classifications](understanding-security-alerts.md#security-alert-classifications).

Lateral Movement consists of techniques that adversaries use to enter and control remote systems on a network. Following through on their primary objective often requires exploring the network to find their target and subsequently gaining access to it. Reaching their objective often involves pivoting through multiple systems and accounts to gain. Adversaries might install their own remote access tools to accomplish Lateral Movement or use legitimate credentials with native network and operating system tools, which may be stealthier. Microsoft Defender for Identity can cover different passing attacks (pass the ticket, pass the hash, etc.) or other exploitations against the domain controller, like PrintNightmare or remote code execution.

## Suspected exploitation attempt on Windows Print Spooler service (external ID 2415)

**Severity**: High or Medium

**Description**:

Adversaries might exploit the Windows Print Spooler service to perform privileged file operations in an improper manner. An attacker who has (or obtains) the ability to execute code on the target, and who successfully exploits the vulnerability, could run arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on a target system. If run against a domain controller, the attack would allow a compromised non-administrator account to perform actions against a domain controller as SYSTEM.

This functionally allows any attacker who enters the network to instantly elevate privileges to Domain Administrator, steal all domain credentials, and distribute further malware as a Domain Admin.

**Learning period**:

## Suspected NTLM authentication tampering (external ID 2039)

**Severity**: Medium

**Description**:

In June 2019, Microsoft published [Security Vulnerability CVE-2019-1040](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1040), announcing discovery of a new tampering vulnerability in Microsoft Windows, when a "man-in-the-middle" attack is able to successfully bypass NTLM MIC (Message Integrity Check) protection.

Malicious actors that successfully exploit this vulnerability have the ability to downgrade NTLM security features, and may successfully create authenticated sessions on behalf of other accounts. Unpatched Windows Servers are at risk from this vulnerability.

In this detection, a Defender for Identity security alert is triggered when NTLM authentication requests suspected of exploiting security vulnerability identified in [CVE-2019-1040](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1040) are made against a domain controller in the network.

**Learning period**:

None

**MITRE**:

|Primary MITRE tactic  | [Lateral Movement (TA0008)](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008)  |
|---------|---------|
|Secondary MITRE tactic    | [Privilege Escalation (TA0004)](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004)     |
|MITRE attack technique  | [Exploitation for Privilege Escalation (T1068)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068/), [Exploitation of Remote Services (T1210)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1210/)        |
|MITRE attack sub-technique |   N/A      |

**Suggested steps for prevention**:

1. Force the use of sealed NTLMv2 in the domain, using the **Network security: LAN Manager authentication level** group policy. For more information, see [LAN Manager authentication level instructions](/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/network-security-lan-manager-authentication-level) for setting the group policy for domain controllers.

1. Make sure all devices in the environment are up-to-date, and patched against [CVE-2019-1040](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1040).

## Suspected NTLM relay attack (Exchange account) (external ID 2037)

**Severity**: Medium or Low if observed using signed NTLM v2 protocol

**Description**:

An Exchange Server computer account can be configured to trigger NTLM authentication with the Exchange Server computer account to a remote http server, run by an attacker. The server waits for the Exchange Server communication to relay its own sensitive authentication to any other server, or even more interestingly to Active Directory over LDAP, and grabs the authentication information.

Once the relay server receives the NTLM authentication, it provides a challenge that was originally created by the target server. The client responds to the challenge, preventing an attacker from taking the response, and using it to continue NTLM negotiation with the target domain controller.

In this detection, an alert is triggered when Defender for Identity identify use of Exchange account credentials from a suspicious source.

**Learning period**:

None

## Exchange Server Remote Code Execution (CVE-2021-26855) (external ID 2414)

**Severity**: High

**Description**:

Some Exchange vulnerabilities can be used in combination to allow unauthenticated remote code execution on devices running Exchange Server. Microsoft has also observed subsequent web shell implantation, code execution, and data exfiltration activities during attacks. This threat may be exacerbated by the fact that numerous organizations publish Exchange Server deployments to the internet to support mobile and work-from-home scenarios. In many of the observed attacks, one of the first steps attackers took following successful exploitation of CVE-2021-26855, which allows unauthenticated remote code execution, was to establish persistent access to the compromised environment via a web shell.

Adversaries may create authentication bypass vulnerability results from having to treat requests to static resources as authenticated requests on the backend, because files such as scripts and images must be available even without authentication.

**Prerequisites**:

Defender for Identity needs Windows Event 4662 to be enabled and collected to monitor for this attack. For information on how to configure and collect this event, see [Configure Windows Event collection](configure-windows-event-collection.md), and follow the instructions for [Enable auditing on an Exchange object](configure-windows-event-collection.md#enable-auditing-on-an-exchange-object).
