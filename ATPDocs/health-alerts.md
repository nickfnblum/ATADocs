## Health issues page

The Microsoft Defender for Identity **Health issues** page lets you know when there's a problem with your Defender for Identity instance, by raising a health alert. To access the page, follow these steps:

1. In [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://security.microsoft.com), go to **Settings** and then **Identities**.

    ![Go to Settings, then Identities.](media/settings-identities.png)

1. Under **General**, select **Health issues**.

    ![Screenshot of the Health issues page.](media/health-alerts/healthissues.png)

1. The **Health issues** page appears, where you can see **Open**, **Closed**, and **Suppressed** health issues.

1. Select any issue for more details, and the option to close or suppress the issue.

## Health alerts

This section describes all the health alerts for each component, listing the cause and the steps needed to resolve the problem.

Sensor-specific health alerts are displayed in the **Sensor health issues** tab and domain related or aggregated health alerts are displayed in the **Global health issues** tab as detailed in the following tables:

### A domain controller is unreachable by a sensor

|Alert|Description|Resolution|Severity|Displayed in|
|----|----|----|----|----|
|The Defender for Identity sensor has limited functionality due to connectivity issues to the configured domain controller.|This affects Defender for Identity's ability to detect suspicious activities related to domain controllers monitored by this Defender for Identity sensor.| Make sure the domain controllers are up and running and that this Defender for Identity sensor can open LDAP connections to them. In addition, in **Settings** make sure to configure a Directory Service account for every deployed forest.|Medium|Sensors health issues tab|

### All/Some of the capture network adapters on a sensor are not available

|Alert|Description|Resolution|Severity|Displayed in|
|----|----|----|----|----|
|All/Some of the selected capture network adapters on the Defender for Identity sensor are disabled or disconnected.|Network traffic for some/all of the domain controllers is no longer captured by the Defender for Identity sensor. This issue affects the ability to detect suspicious activities, related to those domain controllers.|Make sure these selected capture network adapters on the Defender for Identity sensor are enabled and connected.|Medium|Sensors health issues tab|

### Directory services user credentials are incorrect

|Alert|Description|Resolution|Severity|Displayed in|
|----|----|----|----|----|
|The credentials for the directory services user account are incorrect.|This issue affects sensors' ability to detect activities using LDAP queries against domain controllers.|- For a **standard** AD accounts: Verify that the username, password, and domain in the **Directory services** configuration page are correct.<br>- For **group Managed Service Accounts:** Verify that the username and domain in the **Directory Services** configuration page are correct. Also check all the other **gMSA account** prerequisites described on the [Directory Service account recommendations](directory-service-accounts.md) page.|Medium|Global health issues tab|

### Low success rate of active name resolution

|Alert|Description|Resolution|Severity|Displayed in|
|----|----|----|----|----|
|The listed Defender for Identity sensors are failing to resolve IP addresses to device names more than 90% of the time using the following methods:<br />- NTLM over RPC<br />- NetBIOS<br />- Reverse DNS|This affects Defender for Identity's detections capabilities and might increase the number of false positive alarms.|- For NTLM over RPC: Check that port 135 is open for inbound communication from Defender for Identity sensors on all computers in the environment.<br />- For reverse DNS: Check that the sensors can reach the DNS server and that Reverse Lookup Zones are enabled.<br />- For NetBIOS: Check that port 137 is open for inbound communication from Defender for Identity sensors on all computers in the environment.<br />Additionally, make sure that the network configuration (such as firewalls) isn't preventing communication to the relevant ports.|Low|Sensors health issues tab and Global health issues tab|
